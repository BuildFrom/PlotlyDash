## Overview


In this module, we'll explore the intricacies of working with dates and times in data analysis. Dates and times play an essential role in a wide range of datasets, and understanding how to manipulate, visualize, and derive insights from them is crucial. Using the Air Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, we will delve into various techniques that will help in the preprocessing and analysis of such data.

## Core Concepts

Parsing Dates: Before any form of time series analysis, we need to recognize and convert date strings into actual date objects that Python can understand and manipulate.

Cleaning up Data: Real-world data is often messy. We'll learn how to identify missing or inconsistent data and deal with it effectively.

Fixing "Numerical" Strings: At times, numbers might be read as strings, especially when they contain symbols like commas for decimals. We'll fix these to ensure proper numerical analysis.

Making Functions: Encapsulate repetitive tasks into functions. This makes our code more readable and reusable.

Timezones: Time zones can be tricky but are crucial when dealing with global datasets. We'll understand how to localize and convert between different time zones.

Resampling: Convert your time series data to different frequencies, e.g., from hourly to daily data.

Rolling Operations: Smooth out time series data or calculate metrics on a rolling window, like moving averages.

Plotting: Visual representation can help in understanding patterns over time, detecting outliers, and identifying trends.
