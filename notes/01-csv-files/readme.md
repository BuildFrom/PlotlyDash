# Practice Exercises: Understanding Student Data - Analysing and Visualizing Data from a CSV file

## Overview

In this set of exercises, you'll have the opportunity to practice the skills you learned in the module about analyzing and visualizing data from a CSV file. The data set used in this module is the "Student Performance Data Set" from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance).

Remember, it's essential to practice your coding skills. The exercises below are structured to help reinforce what you've learned. If an exercise seems challenging, take your time and try to work through it.

## Core Concepts to Review

### Loading CSVs and PyArrow

- You have learned how to load data from CSVs using the `pandas` library. The PyArrow backend can improve speed and memory usage.

### Summary Stats

- Descriptive statistics give a quick snapshot of the data's main properties.

### Correlations

- Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two numeric variables.

### Cross Tabulations

- Cross-tabulation is a method to quantitatively analyze the relationship between multiple variables.

### Visualizations

- Visualization provides a clear idea of the data's structure and relationships.
