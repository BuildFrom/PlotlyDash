# Practice Exercises for Text Data Processing with Movie Reviews

## Overview

In this section, you'll get hands-on experience working with text data, specifically focusing on movie reviews. You'll learn the nuances of text cleaning, pre-processing, and even some introductory aspects of text classification. Whether you're aspiring to build a sentiment analysis model or just curious about the world of NLP, these exercises are a great starting point.

Remember, it's essential to apply what you've learned to ensure a deeper understanding. So, even if some tasks may seem basic, they're building the foundation for more advanced skills.

## Core Concepts

### Text Cleaning and Pre-processing

Working with raw text data can be messy. Before any analysis or modeling, it's crucial to clean and pre-process the data. Common steps include:
- Removing punctuation
- Lowercasing all the text
- Removing HTML tags, like `<br />`
- Handling contractions (e.g., "don't" to "do not")
- Removing stop words (common words that don't carry significant meaning in analysis)

### Text Vectorization

In order to perform machine learning on text, we need to transform our text data into a numerical format. One common method is TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection.

### Text Classification

With our processed text, we can build models to classify it into various categories, like sentiment (positive or negative). One of the models used in the provided code is XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique. For high-dimensional text data, PCA can help visualize the data in a lower-dimensional space, often just 2D or 3D.
